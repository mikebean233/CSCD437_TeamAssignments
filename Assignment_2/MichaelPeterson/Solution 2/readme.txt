Version 2
Michael Peterson


This version takes multiple stages, the first stage stores the source in a static char array.  This program is built and executed and it produces source with the characters in the static char array converted to integers.  The second stage is the final source for program which will produce a copy of it's self as the output.

Building and running: Run the command "make" from the linux shell.

Note: My solution is a blatent rip off of the solution presented in the handout.
