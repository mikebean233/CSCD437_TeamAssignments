Produce a self-replicating program (running the program produces as output the original source code).
The output should compile and run and produce the identical output once again.

You must utilize one of the following languages: C, C++, Java, C#.  
The fact is, Python and Ruby make this task trivial -- if you know those languages, use them as a starting point!

DO NOT GOOGLE/BING/ETC. FOR ANSWERS!!! Tom has done so and has those solutions in hand.  
If your work is not original, you will receive 0 points.

Provide output captures that show your program self replicates.  Run the program, compile the output, run again, 
then run a diff on the two output files to show they are the same.

Submit a zip file that has: 
(1) your source code
(2) necessary output captures that prove your solution self-replicates
(3) Also include a readme.txt file that includes your team member names and discussion of any shortcomings your 
    program has (if all works well just state 'no shortcomings').

EXTRA CREDIT: 10 additional points if your program automatically self replicates (compiles itself and runs itself to 
produce the identical output -- the original source code)
